  <p>I started my project for easy cooking for teens, my personal project advisor is Ashley Bayles, i have been doing some research on what a teenager wants by interviews and of course me(I'm a teenager), I have come up with clever ideas for lots of recipes but I still haven't try them out, my first trial will be with the brownie in a mug recipe it’s been going on my mind for quite a lot of time, given its consistency and taking in account how much does teens like brownies. I have tried it on June 18 2013, the recipe is already uploaded into my personal project file in Google drive and notes into how to make them and problems you might encounter during the preparation are within the recipe itself.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Last night I remembered a great recipe my uncle used to make and I used to love it, coca cola chicken, I had to asked him of course and he gave it to me, I tried it in my own and discovered a few improvements it can be done to it to make it way better, these are within the recipe and also the problems you might encounter during its preparation.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The same day, giving the opportunity of time that the chicken gave me another idea was baffling through my mind, I love bread, I even love more toast, then I wonder if a variation of toast was possible, then I came up with an idea which will be a revolution for bread itself, I rolled a normal sliced bread with some butter sprayed in it and tried to toast it by putting it in the frying pan, as it turned out it did not maintain its shape, so I had to invent some new kind of way for it to work, I tried with a stick, but the looks were horrible, then it came to me bread was too thick for this kind of process, you can’t cut it because it'll lose its consistency, but what you can do it’s expand it, by molding it, now how in earth will you do that? easy just take a normal pizza molder, but I wasn't able to get one then with the chocolate mixer it hit me, to crush the breath smoothly within the process a natural tube shape should come along, tame butter and gently put it in the outside part of the cylinder, then locate some kind of ingredient in the centre, a kind of bread "tortilla" then put it in the frying pan, until its toast then toast the left part and you are done. Of course after doing all these I realized my chicken was overcooking.</p>
  <br />
  <p>At the beginning of August I found myself in a 1st world predicament, whether to make pasta or meat, I obviously recurred to my thinking and came up with the laziest way of doing it obviously, I recurred to a tomato sauce bistec which was way beyond easy (very easy), I simply cooked it and for some reason put 2 spoons of tomato sauce in it, again my laziness due to the fact I love it but I did not wanted to put it during lunch and I noticed the meat turned a kind of reddish color, little did I know I ended up doing a filet mignon, but it was way too potent in flavor it needed a cup of water, that was my lunch delicious harmless and easy. This relates enormously with the area of interaction, Human Ingenuity because this was actually my own ingenuity and this is what the project is all about how me as a teenager could simply go into the kitchen and just prepare myself an enjoyable dish which is too easy.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Thyme chicken breasts, this recipe was a matter of good luck and more wasted time than recommended, my inventive is beyond limits, I'm just kidding I was hungry and felt curious, I came up with an easy delicious recipe in which I found myself lost in its flavor, the thyme chicken breasts. I won’t get into details with its recipe it was a revelation for my way of cooking conventional but genius. This opened more and more ways to cook. It literally gave me the brilliant idea of the cream milk which I had totally forgot and showed me the simplicity and deliciousness of its cooking.</p>
  <br />
  <p>As most of my recipes, this one came to me like most genius came up with their master pieces (it’s mostly the toilet) I am talking of a sudden strike of hunger I am sure all teenagers suffer from, but this could only be fulfilled by the only, the only thing one as a human being tired with hunger can do, a sandwich, but I got a bit inventive about it and that is how the pulled smoky chicken sandwich was born. I looked for it and it already existed, but mine has a special ingredient that will make your lips and mouths go as open as the great cannon, cheddar!</p>
  <br />
  <p>As a teenager one my favorite deliciousness is of course the nutella. I adore it so much it deserves a much well gained established position in my book a whole article made from it, I started by thinking, everyone likes chocolate chip cookies why aren’t the best cookies in the world named nutella cookies, and then it hit me, the best way to do cookies is with nutella, and it was born the nutella cookie’s, I figured out as I had virtually no knowledge in how to make the actual cookies id research a bit and it turned out someone had already stole it in advance. Then I figure out I try the recipe and give it a little twist myself.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Going with the theme I came up with another great idea to combine deliciousness, how about a Popsicle, but not just any popsicle, it is the popsicle made in the mighty ingredient, the nutella. Then I figured I should start by investigating on popsicles and how to actually make them, so I did my research and the cream milk popped out then I thought well I already got it and I obviously got nutella, I just looked for the right amount of cream milk for some popsicles and the nutella of course and it was literally just those two ingredients, nothing more just these two.</p>
  <br />
  <p>This day I have noticed there’s gastronomy fair at Bogota and I obviously thought well I might as well go and see what there is and get some new ideas. So I went and as I had expected it is all about the brands, all about the publicity and not much about the cooking, meanwhile millions of advertisements were washing my brain I just thought to myself how can the readers of my webpage understand that good food can not only be prepared by great chefs or by fancy expensive restaurants, all you need is your inventive and a basic knowledge in cooking. And I finally came up with the name of my project, teens cook too, because we teenagers can cook and I figured since we’re always complaining we should do it ourselves and that way leave everyone alone. But back to the topic of the fair it did not taught me much as I thought it would do, the special guest was Peru and since I have been there I remembered some of the best food I had eaten in my whole life. But this one hadn’t the special essence it had back there. I asked some of the chefs who were there and they just tried to enroll me in to how good their school was and then I figured it had no point and went home.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Enough nutella for now I haven't focused in the most special and important meal of the day, the breakfast, even if you don't know the breakfast could be one of the most delicious meals of the day as well. I was thinking who doesn't like pizza, I mean if you don't you have something weird going in that head of yours and then it hit me, how all my troubles for the day will be gone, if I could just have breakfast pizza, it does not go of course, but how about a pancake pizza and it was suddenly all over my head a pancake pizza. It worked and it worked as well as frittata pizza. Then I thought to myself well these isn’t very healthy and we as teenagers should eat protein, then just replace the syrup with some freshly made strawberry on it.</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have now decided in this part of the webpage, to relate it to my Colombian heritage. I have started with some carimañolas, a dish of the Caribbean Coast of Colombia which I personally believe it's one of the best and I have always done it, afterwards I've made some delicious plantains filled with guava paste, since it is my favorite. Then the one dish who must always be in the Colombian Gastronomy, the empanadas and my favorite arepa which is made from choclo which is basically corn, really easy and really simple to make.</p>
