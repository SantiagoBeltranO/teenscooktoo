       <p>This page is all about my personal project, and it consists of a simple idea, which is anyone can cook i know it sounds like the movie ratatouille but i am stating cooking shouldnÂ´t be stressful or hard it should be something you can really enjoy by yourself or with others.</p>
       <br />
       <p>Now why teens cook too? this is for proving anyone can cook since i have seen teenagers nowadays do not really care about the gastronomy (even though they eat a whole bunch of food). If i can get teens to cook i can get anyone to cook for themselves and that is my porpouse.</p>
